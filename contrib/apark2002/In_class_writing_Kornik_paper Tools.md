# Kornik's paper highlights six different domains in which researchers can use LLMs such as ChatGPT to help with the creation of their research paper: ideation and feedback, writing, background research, data analysis, coding, and mathematical derivation. For my particular paper on creating a two-dimensional Fama-French factor portfolio in Indian equities, I will mostly be utilizing ChatGPT to improve my writing, creating/debugging my Python script, and checking my mathematical derivations/ fundamental methodology. Even with the initial dataset exercise over the break, I have found ChatGPT to be incredibly useful in drafting simple scripts that can be run on my personal Jupyter notebook. However, as mentioned by Kornik, I try to be very aware of what I am sharing with ChatGPT in terms of proprietary information whether in the form of datasets or the form of portfolio methodology. While not guaranteed, there is a risk that the information I share with the LLM platform will be used for future use cases and training outside of my domain.
