Korinek's paper identifies six key areas where large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can assist researchers: ideation and feedback, writing, background research, data analysis, coding, and mathematical derivation. For my research on developing a two-dimensional Fama-French factor portfolio in Indian equities, I plan to leverage ChatGPT primarily to improve my writing, debug my Python scripts, and verify my mathematical derivations and fundamental methodology. During a recent data analysis exercise, I found ChatGPT helpful in drafting and troubleshooting simple scripts for my Jupyter Notebook. However, as Korinek points out, I remain cautious about sharing proprietary information—such as datasets or portfolio methodologies—on the platform. Despite the benefits, there is an inherent risk that the data I share could be used for future model training or unintended use cases beyond my control.
