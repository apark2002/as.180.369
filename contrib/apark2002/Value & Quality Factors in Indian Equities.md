# Literature Review

Early Developments in Factor-Based Investing
The work of {cite:t}`Fama1992-id` marked a pivotal moment in asset pricing by identifying the size and book-to-market (B/M) ratios as critical factors that explain cross-sectional variations in stock returns. Their research, primarily focused on U.S. markets, demonstrated that these factors provided superior explanatory power compared to the traditional CAPM model, which relied solely on market beta. This laid the foundation for factor-based investing, where characteristics such as size and value (high book-to-market) became central to portfolio construction and risk management.

Their later work, {cite:t}`Fama1993-fj`, expanded this analysis by adding bond market factors and integrating the size and value factors into a comprehensive framework that explained stock returns across different asset classes. This model, however, was based on developed markets, leaving an open question regarding its applicability in emerging markets like India, which tend to exhibit different risk profiles and market dynamics.

Factor Models and Value in Emerging Markets
{cite:t}`Blackburn2020-iq` took a closer look at the book-to-market (B/M) effect in emerging markets. Their study of 25 emerging markets showed that only the tangible component of B/M (linked to past accounting performance) was significantly related to expected returns, whereas the intangible component (price changes not tied to accounting performance) was not. This study is particularly relevant to your work, as it highlights the need to focus on accounting-driven factors, like profitability when constructing a portfolio in emerging markets like India. Their results suggest that, in such markets, profitability linked to tangible outcomes may be a better predictor of future returns than purely market-driven changes in price.

Value and Profitability in India
In India, {cite:t}`M2024-yc` reassessed the application of the Fama-French three-factor model to determine its performance from 2000 to 2023. Their study found that while the size and value factors were relevant, the size factor was more dominant in explaining stock returns in the Indian context. Importantly for your work, they noted that portfolios of large firms with low book-to-market ratios (BL portfolios) demonstrated higher explanatory power. This indicates that when creating a portfolio based on value, focusing on larger firms in India may offer a more reliable strategy, especially when profitability is considered alongside value.

The introduction of a four-factor model in Indian equities by {cite:t}`Agarwalla2014-xp` added further depth to factor-based models in India by incorporating the momentum factor. Their comprehensive analysis from 1993 to 2013 found that value (HML) continued to be a significant factor in Indian equities, delivering an average annual return of 15.3%. However, their study also highlights that profitability, as a factor akin to value, could provide additional explanatory power. Their corrections for survivorship bias and focus on investible portfolios make this study highly relevant, as it underscores the importance of selecting stocks that are liquid and profitable, both of which are central to your portfolio construction.

Profitability as a Factor
While the Fama-French models focus primarily on size and value, recent studies, particularly in emerging markets, have started to emphasize profitability as an important determinant of stock returns. Although less explored in early factor models, profitability—typically measured by returns on assets or equity—offers a complementary view to value by assessing the operational efficiency and future earning potential of firms.

In global research, {cite:t}`Asness2013-jm` found that profitability-based factors correlated strongly across asset classes and markets, much like value and momentum. Their finding that value and profitability factors are negatively correlated suggests that incorporating profitability into a value portfolio could help balance risk exposures, especially in volatile markets like India. This negative correlation also implies that value-oriented portfolios could benefit from incorporating highly profitable firms, as these firms may perform better in market downturns, where traditional value stocks might struggle.

Calendar Effects and Seasonality in Indian Markets
While profitability and value are critical factors in portfolio construction, {cite:t}`Harshita2019-ai` provides insight into unique market phenomena in India, such as the calendar effects that may impact portfolio returns. Their study, which explored 20 years of data from 1995 to 2015, found that small firms were particularly prone to seasonal returns, with higher returns often observed in November and December. This suggests that profitability-based strategies in Indian markets should also account for seasonal effects, particularly for smaller firms, which may experience disproportionate price movements during specific periods of the year.

Avoiding Index Rebalancing Crowds
A complementary strategy when constructing a value and profitability portfolio in India might involve avoiding the inefficiencies introduced by index rebalancing. {cite:t}`Arnott2023-qy` demonstrated that discretionary deletions often outperform additions in major indices like the S&P 500, which likely holds in Indian indices as well. Their work suggests that trading ahead of index funds or delaying reconstitution trades could capture excess returns, further enhancing the profitability of a portfolio focused on value. This aligns with a long-term value strategy, where avoiding market noise and focusing on fundamental performance metrics like profitability can lead to superior performance.

Conclusion
The body of research on factor-based investing in emerging markets, and India in particular, points to the importance of value and profitability as critical factors for constructing successful portfolios. Studies on the Indian market, such as those by {cite:t}`M2024-yc` and {cite:t}`Agarwalla2014-xp`, confirm that value remains a dominant factor in Indian equities, but that profitability offers additional explanatory power. Integrating these factors into a portfolio while considering the unique seasonal patterns and inefficiencies in the Indian market presents a comprehensive strategy for investors seeking to capture long-term returns. Your focus on value and profitability is well-supported by this literature, which highlights the critical role of tangible financial metrics and profitability in predicting future performance in India.

# Abstract

This paper aims to implement a two-dimensional factor strategy in Indian equities, focusing on value and profitability, two factors shown to offer significant explanatory power for stock returns in both developed and emerging markets. Using the Nifty 500 as the investable universe, the study leverages data from Bloomberg Terminal and CMIE's ProwessDX, integrating both market-based and accounting-driven factors. Previous research has highlighted the dominance of value in Indian markets, while recent studies suggest that profitability, especially when linked to tangible financial performance, provides additional predictive power. This paper addresses survivorship bias and look-ahead bias, which are common in factor-based strategies, ensuring robust and reliable results. By combining these factors and accounting for unique market dynamics in India, including seasonal effects and index rebalancing inefficiencies, this study seeks to construct a portfolio capable of generating alpha and outperforming market benchmarks.

# Introduction

Factor-based investing has emerged as a cornerstone of modern asset management, transforming how investors construct portfolios and manage risk. Initially brought to prominence by the work of Fama and French in the early 1990s, factor models identified critical characteristics such as size and value that explained cross-sectional variations in stock returns far better than the traditional Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which relied solely on market beta. Fama and French’s findings, which emphasized the significance of book-to-market (B/M) ratios and firm size, laid the groundwork for the development of multifactor models that have become central to portfolio construction. While the majority of this research has focused on developed markets, emerging markets like India present a unique and largely unexplored frontier for factor-based strategies.

This paper seeks to explore one such frontier by implementing a two-dimensional factor strategy focusing on value and profitability within Indian equities. The Nifty 500, a broad index representing a large portion of the Indian stock market, serves as the investable universe for this study. While value has long been recognized as a critical driver of returns in Indian equities, recent research suggests that profitability—particularly when linked to tangible financial metrics—offers additional explanatory power. Blackburn (2020) demonstrated that in emerging markets, profitability tied to past accounting performance, rather than market-driven price changes, is a more reliable predictor of future returns. This finding is crucial for Indian markets, where tangible, accounting-based factors may provide an edge over purely market-driven indicators. Therefore, this study integrates both value and profitability factors to construct a portfolio designed to generate alpha in the Indian context.

The growing interest in factor-based investing in India has been accompanied by challenges unique to emerging markets. The applicability of factor models developed in the U.S. or other developed markets is often questioned when applied to markets like India, which exhibit different risk-return profiles and market inefficiencies. For example, studies such as Agarwalla (2014) have demonstrated that value remains a dominant factor in Indian equities, delivering high returns, but the inclusion of additional factors, such as profitability or momentum, can enhance portfolio performance. Moreover, emerging markets are often more susceptible to inefficiencies, such as those introduced by seasonal patterns and index rebalancing. Research on Indian equities has shown that small firms, in particular, exhibit seasonal return patterns, often experiencing disproportionate price movements in November and December (Harshita 2019). These unique market phenomena highlight the need for strategies that account for such inefficiencies when constructing portfolios.

Given this backdrop, this paper contributes to the existing literature by addressing two major biases often overlooked in the Indian equity space: survivorship bias and look-ahead bias. Survivorship bias occurs when only stocks that have survived a particular period are considered, skewing results by excluding companies that were delisted or failed during the period of analysis. Look-ahead bias, on the other hand, occurs when portfolio strategies are backtested using information that would not have been available at the time of trading decisions. Both biases can lead to inflated expectations of portfolio performance. This paper aims to mitigate these biases by carefully constructing a value and profitability portfolio that incorporates only the data available at the time of trading while ensuring that stocks that exit the index are accounted for in the analysis.

The importance of this research lies not only in its attempt to refine factor-based strategies for the Indian market but also in its broader implications for emerging markets worldwide. As globalization has increased access to financial markets, investors are seeking more sophisticated tools to navigate the complexities of emerging economies. Factor-based strategies that integrate accounting-driven metrics like profitability can offer investors a structured way to capture returns in these markets. Moreover, by addressing common biases and incorporating insights from recent research, this paper aims to present a more accurate and implementable approach to factor-based investing in Indian equities.

In conclusion, this paper will examine the effectiveness of a two-dimensional factor strategy combining value and profitability within the Nifty 500, leveraging tools such as Bloomberg Terminal and CMIE's ProwessDX to construct a robust dataset. The ultimate goal is to generate alpha through a systematic, data-driven approach while accounting for the unique challenges of investing in Indian equities. In doing so, this research aims to provide a roadmap for both domestic and international investors seeking to capitalize on the growing opportunities in India’s dynamic and evolving equity markets.
