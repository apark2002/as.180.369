#Topic 1: Backtesting and Discovering Web3 Factor Risk Premia
#Factor risks have been widely hypothesized and backtested across various geographies and asset classes. However, only recently has there been a growing interest in applying these frameworks to the cryptocurrency market. This research aims to backtest and potentially discover alternative factors, such as those modeled by Fama-French, to explain historical returns in crypto. By adopting a survivorship-bias-free approach that includes both delisted and failed cryptocurrencies, I will aim to deliver statistically robust insights into the existence of factor premiums in cryptocurrency markets.

#Topic 2: Quantifying Intangible Assets in a Modernizing Economy
#As technology-driven industries continue to dominate many economies, traditional valuation metrics are increasingly challenged. The tangible value of tech companies often lags behind sectors with high capital expenditures and substantial real asset holdings, such as real estate and industrials. This research seeks to explore the complexities of valuing intangible assets and human capital in the tech sector. By reviewing current literature and methodologies, I aim to refine the definition of the "value" factor in stock returns, accounting for the unique characteristics of intangible assets in modern economies.

#Topic 3: An Analysis of Government Expenditure Efficiency and Long-Term Contributions to GDP Growth
3Public investments have long been a tool for policymakers to stimulate GDP growth, but their effectiveness is increasingly debated. While private investments are often seen as more efficient, the literature suggests that public investments may lead to inefficiencies and losses. My research will focus on evaluating the cost-benefit dynamics of public investment in relation to rising debt-to-GDP ratios. The central question is whether public investments are indeed less efficient at capital allocation compared to the private sector and what impact they have on long-term economic growth.
