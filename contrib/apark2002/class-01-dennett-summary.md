# Reaction to Dennett Article

# Dennett argues that regulators should tighten their stance on handling 'deepfakes' and other AI-generated counterfeits of people, news, etc. Dennett's argument is two-fold. First, regulators should tighten their stance against the actual AI platforms themselves in terms of including in-house 'water-marks' to quickly determine whether the AI platforms generated the media. Dennett points to a similar case in the past in which European regulators forced printing companies to install permanent software to detect when currency is being copied, and then to place a watermark on that copy. Dennett also argues that the laws on perpetrators should tighten as well where the repercussions will be severe and therefore highly discourage many from participating. I agree that regulators need to make (at least) the second part of Dennett's argument a reality. While yellow journalism and general fake news have existed virtually forever, the threat and quality of these counterfeits have grown tremendously through AI and machine learning. As a result, due to changing technological landscapes, regulators must adapt their laws to match the severity and danger of fake media.
