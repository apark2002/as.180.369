# This paper evaluates the effectiveness of various valuation multiples, such as Book-to-Price (B/P), Price-to-Earnings (P/E), Earnings Per Share (EPS), and Cash Earnings Per Share (CEPS), in capturing the value factor across the Nifty 500 universe over a comprehensive time series. Through an empirical analysis of the Indian equity market, the study identifies the most predictive multiples for extracting the value premium. Furthermore, the paper explores how strategic sector rotation and rebalancing, timed to macroeconomic cycles, can enhance the collection of risk premia by leveraging value and quality factors. These findings aim to provide actionable insights for optimizing portfolio performance in Indiaâ€™s dynamic market.
