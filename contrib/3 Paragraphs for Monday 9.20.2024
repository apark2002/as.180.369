# Topic 1: Backtesting and Discovering Web3 Factor Risk Premia 
# While factor risks have been hypothesized and backtested over a variety of geographies and asset classes, only recently has their been a growing traction for the cryptocurrency asset class. This topic is to backtest and potentially discover alternative/Fama-French factors to describe historical returns. I will take a survivorship-bias free approach utilizing the entire universe (including delisted and failed cryptocurrencies) to deliver statistically significant conclusions about factor premiums in crypto markets. 

# Topic 2: Quantifying Intangible Assets in a Modernizing Economy
# As the technology industries continue to grow in prominence in many economies, the tangible value of these companies has been severly lagging against sectors with higher capital expenditure and real asset holdings (real estate, industrials, materials). As a result, there has been a difficulty in valuating the worth of intangible assets and human capital in tech companies. I hope to review the literature of accounting for intangible assets and hope to create a refined methodology to define the "value" factor in stock returns. 

# Topic 3: An Analysis of Government Expenditure Efficiency and Long-Term Contributions to GDP Growth
# In many economies, policymakers have and continue to rely on public investments as a way to stimulate/capture GDP growth. However, there has been a variety of literature that argues public investments tends to be less efficient and loss-generating. I hope to analyze the cost-reward of utilizing public investments to stimulate the economy through increasing Debt/GDP levels. The primary question I hope to answer is whether public investments are significantly inefficient in allocating capital than private markets.
